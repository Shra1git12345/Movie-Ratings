# Movie-Ratings
Mini Project
In data science, we study data sets and use the gathered information to make better decisions. 
Recommender systems are an important tool that help filter data that might be of interest to the user. 
Recommender systems are utilised in a variety of areas, including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags and general products.
Now, here is a Python assignment for you where you will use your learnings to create a simple movie recommendation system.
Please download the Jupyter notebook at the link given below and execute the tasks mentioned in it. The data to work with is also available for download.
The overall task is to build a set of functions that will act as a simple movie recommendation system. 
The recommender system must recommend the top three movies to a user based on their previously searched movies.
In this exercise, you will perform the following tasks:

Load and study the data.
Create a function to calculate the angle between the user rating vectors for two movies.
Create a function to print the names of the top three movies most similar to the movie that a user watched recently.
The "User_Movie_Ratings_Graded.csv" data is a completely fabricated data set
ny resemblance to entities past, present or future is merely a coincidence.

Feature Description:
The data set contains ratings given by users to movies on a scale of 1 to 5.
Each row contains the ratings given to all the movies by a particular user.
Each column contains the ratings given to a particular movie by all the users.
